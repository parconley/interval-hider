# Anki Add-on: Hide Expected Review Interval

> Your brain knows if you know something. Your eyes seeing intervals makes you second-guess. Trust your brain.

A simple Anki add-on that hides the expected review interval (like "10d" or "2min") that normally appears beneath each answer button during card review.

## Why Use This Add-on?

When reviewing cards, seeing the upcoming intervals can unconsciously bias your decision:
- You might choose "Hard" instead of "Again" if you see the "Again" interval is very short
- You might avoid "Easy" if you see it will push a card too far into the future
- You might pick "Good" by default without truly assessing your knowledge

By hiding these intervals, you can:
- Make decisions based purely on how well you knew the answer
- Develop a more honest assessment of your knowledge
- Trust Anki's algorithm to handle the scheduling
