# Hide Expected Review Interval

A simple add-on that hides the expected review interval (like "10d" or "2min") that normally appears beneath each answer button during card review.

## Purpose

When reviewing cards, seeing the expected intervals can bias your decision when choosing a rating. This add-on helps remove that bias by hiding this information, allowing you to focus solely on how well you knew the card.

## How it Works

The add-on replaces the interval text with an empty spacer, maintaining the layout of the review screen but removing the time information.

## Compatibility

- Works with Anki 2.1.50 and above
- Compatible with both V2 and V3 schedulers

## No Configuration Needed

This add-on works automatically after installation with no configuration required.
